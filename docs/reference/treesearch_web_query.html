A moth and four species of beetles cause most of the damage; the carpenterworm moth, the oak timberworm, the red oak borer, the living-beech borer, and the white oak borer. The larvae of these insects chew holes in the wood ranging from...Author(s):Jimmy R. GalfordYear:1989Keywords:Source:In: Hutchinson, Jay G., ed. Central hardwood notes.
