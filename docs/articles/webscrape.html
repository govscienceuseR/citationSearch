<p>The citationSearch package is a tool used to search citations against online libraries such as Treesearch, Agricola, Bureau of Land Management and National Forest Service Library.</p>
<p>With the exception of the Agricola site, there is a functionality for downloading every possible search result (generally by submitting an empty search). The functions involved in the package allows a user to download the full collections so that they could be searched locally as well.</p>
<p>Some of the library collections involved are the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/">Treesearch library</a>, the NSFL library, the BLM library, and the Agricola collection.</p>
<p>This vignette introduces basic concepts to get started with citationSearch.</p>
<p>To begin, we first need to load the citationSearch package.</p>

<p><code><a href="../reference/treesearch_web_query.html">treesearch_web_query()</a></code> queries the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/">Treesearch website</a> (under the United States Department of Agriculture) with a given search parameter. It accepts the following parameters: <em>keywords</em> (all fields) or <em>title</em>, <em>author last name</em>, <em>date range</em>, <em>FS station</em>, <em>FS series</em>, and/or <em>volume</em>. Running the function will returns a dataframe of titles, the treesearch id, and text of the top 20 results.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/treesearch_get_metadata_one.html">treesearch_get_metadata_one()</a></code> takes in a string of any treesearch ID and returns a dataframe of the information on each entry.</p>

A moth and four species of beetles cause most of the damage; the carpenterworm moth, the oak timberworm, the red oak borer, the living-beech borer, and the white oak borer. The larvae of these insects chew holes in the wood ranging from...Author(s):Jimmy R. GalfordYear:1989Keywords:Source:In: Hutchinson, Jay G., ed. Central hardwood notes.

A very common option for removing this biological trend is to fit a modified negative exponential curve to the...Author(s):Franco Biondi; Fares QeadanYear:2008Keywords:long-term research, ponderosa pine, range research, silviculture, cultural resources, Fort Valley Experimental Forest, Long Valley Experimental Forest, http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/fortvalley/Source:In: Olberding, Susan D., and Moore, Margaret M., tech. coords.

<p><code><a href="../reference/agricola_query.html">agricola_query()</a></code> queries the two <a href="https://agricola.nal.usda.gov/vwebv/selectDatabase.do?dbCode=AGRI2DB&amp;dbCode=LOCAL">NAL Agricola databases</a> (journal articles and other materials) with a given search parameter. It takes in an RSelenium remote driver object and for the search fields, it accepts a <em>title</em>, <em>author</em>, <em>keyword</em>, <em>isbn</em>, <em>language</em>, <em>publisher</em>, <em>series</em>, <em>subject</em>, and/or <em>source.</em> (<em>Note: The search can use at most three fields. If more are supplied, the function will ignore them.</em>) The query function returns dataframe of titles and links.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the function requires the installation of RSelenium beforehand, as it takes in a remote driver for it to load correctly. For the <code><a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/RSelenium/reference/remoteDriver-class.html">remoteDriver()</a></code> to open, you can download and run a docker container. Running a docker container is a simpler way to load and open the function because it removes many of the issues user may have relating to JAVA/browser version/selenium version etc. Specifically, we will be using the Docker application. You can follow instructions for downloading and running Docker <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/vignettes/docker.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you successfully load a Docker server, you can now run the <code>agricola_web_query()</code> function. This function takes in at most three parameters:</p>
